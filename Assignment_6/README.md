Assignment 6 comprised of all the concepts we had learned in this class. Right from the basics of Python to writing complex code, this assignment included everything. The dataset is about the Analysis of Health Inspections of Restaurants Across Prince George's County. We first look at the missing values and handle them either by removing or imputing them. Next we process some variables and transform them to be ready for data analysis, eg. Segregating dates into year, month, day. Next, we ask crucial questions like the toal number of violations made by a restaurant or how many reinspections did it take the restuarants to become compliant again. We formulate these using tables and we also draw some visualizations to display them in the form of graphs.
