    "### Observation\n",
    "1. Comparing the socially responsible investments with corporate investments, Blackrock as a whole has a total AUM of 7.3T dollars whereas the share for social causes is only 65.4B dollars. Vanguard group sums a total of 6.1T but contributes a mere 8.7B dollars. These companies obviously have a better AUM return when it comes to corporate investments.\n",
    "2. Similarly, data suggests that the Expense ratio for non social responsible funds is lesser than the social responsible funds. Which means, companies having non social responsible funds are gonna be more profitable as compared to the socially responsible Funds.\n",
    "3. Although, AUM and Expense Ratio is in favour of non socially responsible companies, the 3month old transaction returns for socially responsible funds is greater than their counterparts."
